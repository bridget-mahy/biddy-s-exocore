### First post
I'm in a new city and am meeting new people for the first time in a long time. It has felt strange being here but I'm enjoying the newness and the atmosphere. Many things have happened in terms of the heart and I have met some new and wonderful people, although at night, potentially due to all the excitement wracking my body and mind recently during the day, I still feel a particular loneliness. This **loneliness** is different from the type that I experienced while living in isolation with my family for ten months. It is different because I am around many *unfamiliar* people all the time who I can't talk to whereas, when I was at my family's house, I was around few *familiar* people constantly who I could say basically anything to. 

I hope that I can learn markdown here at least lol.
